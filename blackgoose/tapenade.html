<h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>

<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and its always a big hit at </br> 
parties. My father recommends:<p>

<p>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just</br>
bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try 
serving it warm"<p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

1 80z. jar sundried tomatoes</br>
2 large garlic cloves</br>
2/3 c. kalamata olives</br>
1 t. capers

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Combine tomatoes and garlic ina food processor. Blend until as smooth</br>
as possible.<p>

<p>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are</br>

texture.<p>
