<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
Posted by BGB, November 15, 2016
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking
technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i>
cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a
water bath that is precisley set to a target temperature you want the
food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p><br>

<p>Next Month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill
Hollindaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the che table, contact us before
<time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>

Location:<br> Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA<br>

<p>Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm<p>
