<h2>Low And Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am exteremly excited about a new</br> cooking technique called sous vide</br> cooking, you submerge the food(usually
vacumm-sealed</br> in plastic) into a water bath that is precisley</br> set to the targer temperature you want the food</br> to be cooked to.
In his book, Cooking For Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature</br> poaching.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon</br> with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef</br> table, contact us before, November 30.</p>

pasteurzed. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have</br>
immunity issues</br>
